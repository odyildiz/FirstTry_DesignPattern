# FirstTry_DesignPattern

This is the project that I made for Design Pattern course in my university.

I tried to use Factory Method Pattern and Strategy Pattern.

Assignment
------------------------------------
You are asked to deliver your project to be as flexible as possible using design patterns. An implemented version is given for better understanding.
Design and implement your project with respect to the following constraints.
1. The application should be able to create a Shape object, which could be a Rectangle, a Circle, or a Square.
 Rectangle has two properties of width and length
 Circle has a radius property
 Square has a length property
2. A Shape can calculate its own area and print out properties
3. A Shape can have additional properties, i.e., Color(string), Light (int), and Contrast (int)
4. If the shape has any of above properties, it will also print out these properties in addition to base properties.
5. A Shape can be made of Gold (au), Iron (fe), and Copper (cu) materials
6. Material of the Shape should be changeable at runtime
7. Material determines mass of the shape, i.e., area × density where Gold, Iron, and Copper have densities of 19.32, 7.874, and 8.96 respectively.
